## CPSC 120

* [Lab 2](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-02-KevsterV)

    Lab 2, part-3 was a favorite because it my very first time getting to know coding. The purpose for this lab was get familiar with the basics like git cloning, making changes on visual code and pushing those changes in the terminal to github. Part-3 was about using format and lint, we were provided with a program that worked but needed some cleaning. It was my job to fix the program to make it look crispy clean.

* [Lab 7](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-07-helen-and-landon/tree/main/part-2)

    Lab 7, part-2 was a favorite because it was the first game we coded. When coding blackjack it was a little challenging at the start but as we continued it started to make sense. At this point I started to feel great about coding even though this was the basics of coding, making a blackjack game from almost scratch was a homerun for me.

* [Lab 12](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-12-jeet-m-and-kevin-v/tree/main/part-1)

    Lab 12, part-1 is my all-time favorite even though this was the most challenging of all the labs we have done, the outcome was beautiful. We would use every piece of knowledge that we learned from previous labs into making an interesting program. The purpose for this lab was to create a program that prints out an animated gradient image gif.
